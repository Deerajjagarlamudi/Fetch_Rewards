This is a native Android app built using Jetpack Compose and Kotlin, developed as a coding exercise for the Fetch Rewards hiring process. The app fetches a list of items from a remote API and displays them efficiently using Paging 3, grouped and sorted by listId and name.

This project is built using the latest Android tools and modern libraries to ensure smooth performance and clean architecture:
	•	Kotlin – The entire app is written in Kotlin for safer and more concise code.
	•	Jetpack Compose – Used to build a modern, responsive UI using the latest Android UI toolkit.
	•	Retrofit – For handling API calls and network communication.
	•	Gson – To parse the JSON response from the API easily.
	•	OkHttp Logging Interceptor – Helps with debugging by logging API requests and responses.
	•	Paging 3 – Implements efficient, on-demand data loading using the official Paging library.
	•	Jetpack ViewModel & StateFlow – Manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware way, keeping the UI updated.
	•	Paging Compose Integration – Used to bind paging data to the Compose UI smoothly.
